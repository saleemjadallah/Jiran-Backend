## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Configure Relationships

You need to add relationship fields manually in the Directus UI:

#### In `products` collection:
```
- seller_id → Many to One → directus_users
- category_id → Many to One → categories
```

#### In `live_streams` collection:
```
- seller_id → Many to One → directus_users
```

#### In `product_tags` collection:
```
- stream_id → Many to One → live_streams
- product_id → Many to One → products
```

#### In `transactions` collection:
```
- buyer_id → Many to One → directus_users
- seller_id → Many to One → directus_users
- product_id → Many to One → products
- stream_id → Many to One → live_streams
```

#### In `offers` collection:
```
- product_id → Many to One → products

- seller_id → Many to One → directus_users
```

#### In `conversations` collection:

### 2. Configure Permissions

**Settings → Roles & Permissions**

#### Public Role:
- **categories**: ✅ Read (all)
- **platform_fees**: ✅ Read (all)
- **products**: ✅ Read (status = active)
- **live_streams**: ✅ Read (is_live = true OR status = ended)
- All other collections: ❌ No access

#### Administrator Role:
- All collections: ✅ Full CRUD access

#### Create Custom Roles:
- **Seller**: Can create/update own products, streams
- **Buyer**: Can create offers, reviews, messages
- **Moderator**: Can review reports, update statuses

### 3. Customize Display Templates

For each collection, set display template in Settings → Data Model:

- **categories**: `{{name}}`
- **products**: `{{title}} - AED {{price}}`
- **live_streams**: `{{title}} ({{status}})`
- **transactions**: `#{{transaction_number}} - AED {{amount}}`
- **reviews**: `{{rating}}⭐ by {{reviewer_id}}`
- **notifications**: `{{title}}`

### 4. Set Up Filters & Presets

Create common filters:
- **Products**: Status = Active, Feed Type = Discover
- **Live Streams**: Is Live = True
- **User Verification**: Status = Pending
- **Reports**: Status = Pending
- **Transactions**: Payment Status = Completed

### 5. Test API Endpoints

```bash
# Get categories
curl http://localhost:8055/items/categories

# Get active products
curl "http://localhost:8055/items/products?filter[status][_eq]=active"

# Get live streams
curl "http://localhost:8055/items/live_streams?filter[is_live][_eq]=true"

# Get platform fees
curl http://localhost:8055/items/platform_fees
```

### 6. Integrate with FastAPI

Update your FastAPI backend to use Directus as the database:

```python
# Example endpoint
@app.get("/api/categories")
async def get_categories():
    response = requests.get(
        f"{DIRECTUS_URL}/items/categories",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {DIRECTUS_TOKEN}"}
    )
    return response.json()
```

### 7. Create Sample Data

Add some test data:
- 5-10 sample products
- 2-3 sample live streams
- Sample users (sellers/buyers)
- Sample transactions
- Sample reviews

3. **Set up proper role permissions** before going live
4. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
5. **Enable HTTPS** in production
6. **Set up rate limiting** on API endpoints

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Can't see collections in Directus UI
- Refresh browser (Ctrl+R / Cmd+R)
- Clear cache
- Check role permissions

### API returns 403 Forbidden
- Check authentication token
- Verify role permissions
- Ensure collection access is enabled

### Relationships not working
- Ensure both collections exist
- Create relationship fields manually in UI
- Use correct relationship type (M:1, 1:M, M:M)
