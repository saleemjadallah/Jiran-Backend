   - Composite index: [is_archived_buyer, is_archived_seller]
   - Purpose: Filter archived conversations

3. **ix_messages_conversation_created**
   - Composite index: [conversation_id, created_at]
   - Purpose: Fetch messages for conversation ordered by time

4. **ix_messages_is_read**
   - Index: [is_read]
   - Purpose: Filter unread messages

5. **ix_offers_status_expires**
   - Composite index: [status, expires_at]
   - Purpose: Find pending offers near expiration (background job)

6. **ix_offers_buyer_created**
   - Composite index: [buyer_id, created_at]
   - Purpose: List buyer's offers chronologically

7. **ix_offers_seller_created**
   - Composite index: [seller_id, created_at]

## Architecture Highlights

### Real-Time Communication Stack

**WebSocket Layer**:
- Socket.IO AsyncServer (ASGI mode)
- JWT authentication via query params or headers
- Room-based communication (user rooms, conversation rooms, product rooms)
- Redis-backed connection tracking
- Horizontal scaling ready (Redis message queue support)

**Connection Management**:
- In-memory tracking for current process
- Redis for cross-process state
- Automatic cleanup of stale connections
- Heartbeat monitoring (2-minute TTL)

**Event-Driven Architecture**:
- Client sends events (e.g., message:send)
- Server processes and validates
- Server emits response events (e.g., message:new)
- Broadcast to relevant rooms/users

### Dual-Feed Integration

**Discover Feed** (Broadcast Shopping):
- Professional sellers
- Live shopping cart
- Public chat in video overlay
- Platform fee: 15% (Free tier)

**Community Feed** (Peer-to-Peer):
- Local neighborhood sales
- Make Offer button + scrolling offers feed
- Direct messages (1-to-1)
- Platform fee: 5% (Free tier)

**Offer System**:
- Works in both feeds
- Real-time offer chips scroll on Community videos
- Redis-backed offer feed (last 20 offers per product)
- 24-hour expiration with automatic cleanup

### Security & Performance

**Authentication**:
- JWT tokens required for WebSocket connections
- Token parsed from query params or Authorization header
- User ID stored in connection manager

**Authorization**:
- Conversation access verified (buyer or seller only)
- Offer actions restricted by role (seller can accept/decline/counter)
- Product ownership validated for offer viewing

**Performance Optimizations**:
- 7 composite indexes for fast queries
- Redis caching for online users
- Redis caching for offer feeds
- Cursor-based pagination for messages
- Eager loading with selectinload to avoid N+1 queries

**Error Handling**:
- HTTP 404 for not found
- HTTP 403 for unauthorized
- HTTP 400 for validation errors
- WebSocket error events with descriptive messages
- Graceful connection cleanup on errors
